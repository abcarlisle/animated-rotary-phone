BOM Import:
- Accept CAD exports (CSV, XLSX, etc.)
- Each company has their own BOM CAD export
- Parse file and auto-detect fields like part number, quantity, description
- If format is unclear, prompt user to map columns
- Save mappings per company, Save template config for that company
- Upload to S3
- Fail gracefully and ask for help if parsing fails
