Cloud: AWS
Infra-as-Code: CDK

Services:
- API: AWS Lambda via API Gateway
- Database: DynamoDB (BOM, Inventory, Orders, etc.)
- Storage: S3 for BOM CAD exports
- Auth: Auth0 (federated with Cognito if needed)
- Jobs: Step Functions for workflows
- Secrets: Parameter Store

Design Goals:
- Validate inputs before writes
- Workflow logic based on role and BOM status
- Track changes per part
- Alerts for missing or suspicious data

Implementation Notes:
- Lambda functions to handle CRUD and import processing
- DynamoDB as core datastore
- S3 for uploading raw CAD BOM exports
- EventBridge for triggering workflows
- All backend logic checks for errors and optimizes step execution
